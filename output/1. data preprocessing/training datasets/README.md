The datasets in "absolute" contain the objective fractions of counts per gene per sample. This means that we do normalisation for the entire dataset prior to subsetting for genes and cell types.

The datasets in "relative" contain the relative fractions of counts per gene per sample. This means that we do normalisation after we have subsetted a set of genes and/or cell types.
